To do:

* Login
	* Login should redirect after completion
	* Login does not persist on page change
	* Decide what to do with errors (maybe status can include error state?)

* Reorganize Home and other initial pages using the current `<App />` page as a template

Then:

* Build edit and delete functionality for users and polls

# Vote!

Next up:

* Mongo authentication error when deployed to heroku
* Chart transitions, reconfigure to work with React updates, add transitions
* Using localStorage prevents different users on one computer from voting on the same poll

Potential future projects:

* Catch 401 error on failed login (instead of using alert)
* Move disable voting logic from localStorage to localStorage or require login for voting and keep an array of voted polls in the user info

# Vote!

Vote! is an application that allows you to create, edit, share, and participate in online polls. It is built using D3.js, React, Flux, and Bootstrap on the front end and connected to a Node server and a MongoDB backend. See the working app [here](https://cjwit-vote.herokuapp.com).

Known issues:

* Nav bar does not work on mobile
* Remove login notifications and other console.logs

Potential future developments:

* Chart transitions, reconfigure to work with React updates, add transitions
* Consider different options than Session Storage to collect voting histories

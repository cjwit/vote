# Vote!

Next up:

* Delete buttons on poll options should not be there if you are not poll owner
* Nav bar does not work on mobile

Potential future projects:

* Chart transitions, reconfigure to work with React updates, add transitions
* Using sessionStorage allows user to reload to vote
* Catch 401 error on failed login (instead of using alert)

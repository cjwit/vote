# Vote!

Next up:

* Finish conversion to ES6

	* Begin with PollList.jsx

* Nav bar does not work on mobile

* Chart transitions, reconfigure to work with React updates, add transitions

* Using sessionStorage allows user to reload to vote

Potential future projects:

* Catch 401 error on failed login (instead of using alert)

* Move disable voting logic from sessionStorage to sessionStorage or require login for voting and keep an array of voted polls in the user info

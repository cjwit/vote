# Vote!

Vote! is an application that allows you to create, edit, share, and participate in online polls. It is built using D3.js, React, Flux, and Bootstrap on the front end and connected to a Node server and a MongoDB backend. See the working app [here](https://cjwit-vote.herokuapp.com).

**Note: this isn't currently working and I'm in the process of making some updates.**

To start server, run:

```
npm install
npm run start
```

To start dev tools, switch to older Node version with NVM (I'm using 8 instead of my installed 12) and run Gulp:

```
nvm use 8
gulp
```
